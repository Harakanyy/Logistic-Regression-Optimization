# Logistic-Regression-Optimization
The objective of the project is to gain a deep understanding of how machine learning models train on data. Moreover, the purpose is to gain knowledge on how models update their parameters using different optimization techniques. As well as to study and know the different optimization techniques used and their different features.

# Project requirements
1. Construct a class for the logistic regression algorithm.
2. Import synthetic data from scikit-learnâ€™s dataset class or use any dataset
you wish. (Dataset must be for binary classification).
3. Identify, calculate and print the loss at each epoch.
4. Display a confusion matrix
5. Calculate classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1 Score)
6. Use and compare these optimizers in terms of the metrics.
  -Gradient Descent
  -Batch Gradient Descent
  -Stochastic Gradient Descent
  -Mini batch gradient descent
